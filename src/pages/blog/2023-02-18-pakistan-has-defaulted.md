In a recent statement, **Pakistan Defense Minister** Khawaja Asif said that Pakistan has defaulted, we are living in a defaulted Pakistan.

Hï»¿e further said that PTI and Imran Khan settled banned TTP inside Pakistan and last night attack on Karachi Police Office was carried out by banned TTP. He indirectly hold PTI and Imran Khan responsible.

Within only one year, in PML-N era , Pkr goes from 179 to even 300 or more and inflation skyrocketed and also a new wave of terrorism started in Pakistan. And this type of statement by a Pakistani Defence Minister doesn't show any hope for Pakistan or Pakistanis
